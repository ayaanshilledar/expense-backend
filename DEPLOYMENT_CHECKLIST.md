# Deployment Checklist

This checklist summarizes all the changes made to make the Expense Tracker application deployment-ready.

## Backend (Render Deployment)

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in your Render dashboard:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
CLIENT_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
PORT=10000
```

### Build and Start Commands
- Build command: `npm install`
- Start command: `npm start` (runs `node server.js`)

## Frontend (Vercel Deployment)

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variable in your Vercel dashboard:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
```

### Build Settings
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Install command: `npm install`

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes
- **CORS Configuration**: Updated [server.js](backend/server.js) to use proper CORS settings with CLIENT_URL from environment variables
- **Removed Development Logging**: Eliminated all console.log and console.error statements for production readiness
- **Environment Variables**: Added [.env.example](backend/.env.example) file for deployment guidance

### 2. Frontend Changes
- **Dynamic API URLs**: Updated [api.js](frontend/src/services/api.js) to use VITE_API_BASE_URL environment variable for API calls
- **Removed Proxy Configuration**: Removed localhost proxy from [vite.config.js](frontend/vite.config.js) since we're using environment variables
- **Removed Development Logging**: Eliminated all console.error statements for production readiness
- **Environment Variables**: Added [.env.example](frontend/.env.example) file for deployment guidance

### 3. Security Enhancements
- All sensitive configuration is now handled through environment variables
- No hardcoded URLs or secrets in the codebase
- Proper CORS configuration to allow communication between frontend and backend

## Verification Steps

Before deploying, verify that:

- [ ] All environment variables are set correctly in your deployment platforms
- [ ] MongoDB connection string is valid
- [ ] JWT secret is sufficiently random and secure
- [ ] Client URL matches your frontend deployment URL
- [ ] Backend URL matches your backend deployment URL

## Post-Deployment Testing

After deployment, test that:

- [ ] User registration and login work correctly
- [ ] Expense CRUD operations function properly
- [ ] Summary cards display correct data
- [ ] No CORS errors appear in the browser console
- [ ] No 404 errors occur when accessing API endpoints
- [ ] Frontend loads data correctly from the deployed backend

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **CORS Errors**: Verify CLIENT_URL in backend matches your frontend deployment URL
2. **404 Errors**: Check that API_BASE_URL in frontend matches your backend deployment URL
3. **Connection Errors**: Verify MONGO_URI is correct and your MongoDB instance is accessible
4. **Authentication Issues**: Ensure JWT_SECRET is set and consistent between deployments

By following this checklist, your Expense Tracker application should deploy successfully with zero errors.
